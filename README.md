## 📖 Overview

**MedVault** is a digital healthcare solution designed to solve the fragmentation of medical history. It empowers patients with full ownership of their data while providing doctors with a streamlined, verified method to access records and issue digital prescriptions.

The core philosophy is **Security via Consent**: Doctors can only view patient data when explicitly granted access via a unique, time-limited code generated by the patient.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 For Patients
* **Centralized Dashboard:** View personal details, medical history, and active sessions.
* **Secure Record Storage:** Upload and store MRI scans, X-rays, and blood reports in a digital vault.
* **Access Control:** Generate unique **Access Codes** (e.g., `MV-W02CLI`) to share specific data with doctors securely.
* **Prescription Management:** Track prescription history and view status updates (e.g., **Valid** vs. **Used**) to prevent reuse/fraud.

### 👨‍⚕️ For Doctors
* **Verified Access:** Enter patient access codes to instantly retrieve medical history.
* **Holistic Patient View:** View all uploaded patient files (Scans, Reports) in one place for better diagnosis.
* **Digital Prescribing:** Create clear, digital prescriptions (Medicine, Dosage, Duration) that instantly sync to the patient's dashboard.

## 🚀 How It Works (Workflow)

1.  **Patient Login:** Patient logs in and uploads recent medical records (e.g., MRI Scan).
2.  **Generate Code:** Patient generates a secure 6-digit access code from their dashboard.
3.  **Doctor Access:** Doctor receives the code, enters it into the MedVault portal, and gains temporary access to the patient's profile.
4.  **Consultation & Prescription:** Doctor reviews files and issues a digital prescription.
5.  **Instant Sync:** The prescription appears instantly in the Patient's dashboard, ready for pharmacy verification.
